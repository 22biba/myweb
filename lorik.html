                <p><em><strong>Lorik Agim Cana</strong></em> Lorik Cana, born on July 27, 1983, is a retired Albanian footballer who played in various top divisions across Europe. He notably represented clubs like Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille, Sunderland, Galatasaray, Lazio, and FC Nantes. Cana played a pivotal role for the Albanian national team and holds the record for the most appearances, with 93 caps, until his retirement in 2016 after the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament. Initially a defensive and central midfielder, he later transitioned to playing as a center-back.

                    Cana began his football journey with the local team Dardania Lausanne in 1997, eventually signing with Paris Saint-Germain in 2000. He had a successful tenure at PSG, winning the Coupe de France and featuring prominently in Ligue 1.
                    
                    Moving to Marseille in 2005, Cana continued to excel, becoming a vital part of the team and even captaining the side. His career path took him to Sunderland in the Premier League in 2009, where he became the first Albanian-origin player in the league.
                    
                    A move to Galatasaray followed in 2010, then on to Lazio in 2011, where he had significant contributions despite facing some injury setbacks. His time at Lazio saw him being part of the squad that secured a fourth-place finish in Serie A.
                    
                    Cana made a decision to play for the Albanian national team despite being eligible for Switzerland or France due to possessing all three passports. He debuted for Albania in 2003 and eventually became the team's captain in 2011, representing his country in various international competitions, including the historic UEFA Euro 2016.
                    
                    Off the field, Cana was inspired by his father, retired footballer Agim Cana, and had a strong interest in archeology, expressing his desire to work in the field of Albanology after his football career. He became a father for the first time in September 2016.
                    
                    Cana's career was marked by significant achievements, serving his clubs and country with distinction before retiring from professional football after Euro 2016. His legacy remains prominent in Albanian football, particularly as a record-holder for the national team's appearances..</p>
