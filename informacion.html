      <div class="histo">
      <p>The history of Albanian football is rich and diverse, marked by significant events and the growth of the sport throughout the years.

       <br> The origins of football in Albania can be traced back to the early 20th century, around 1905-1908. Initially, the game was played informally with makeshift equipment, like a ball wrapped in rags, demonstrating the budding interest in the sport. Football gained traction in various cities such as Shkodra, Vlora, Tirana, Durres, and Korca, among others, with the formation of local teams.
      <p>The establishment of sports societies, such as Vllaznia in 1919, played a pivotal role in integrating sports, culture, and youth activities. Football was not only about sports but also about literary endeavors, culture, theater, music, and gymnastics.</p>

        <p>In the years between the first and second world wars, football faced challenges and restrictions, notably during the leadership of King Zog. However, the sport continued to gain popularity and influence despite limitations.</p>

       <p>The post-liberation period until 1950 marked a significant shift and development in Albanian football. The sport began to flourish with increased interest, the creation of more teams, and the organization of championships. Notably, in 1946, Albania hosted the Balkan Games, where the national team achieved success, winning the championship, showcasing the talent of Albanian footballers.<br>The period saw the emergence of key teams like Partizan, whose success further contributed to the growth and recognition of Albanian football, both domestically and on an international level.</p>
       <p>Albanian football witnessed international engagements and successes, with victories against teams from countries like Macedonia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, further establishing its presence in the broader football community.

        <br>The years leading up to 1950 were characterized by a surge in interest, achievements, and recognition of the sport. Football became a symbol of passion and sportsmanship for Albanian youth, reflecting the dedication and sacrifices made by people in various cities for the love of the game.
        
        The progress made in these early years laid the foundation for the future growth and development of football in Albania.</p>
       <p>This team is different because it unites the entire nation beyond the borders of Albania. In its history, the Albanian national team has had many good and successful moments in various competitions. The peak and greatest achievement so far remains its participation in Euro 2016. It will be remembered not only as a random participant but also as a fantastic performance against European powerhouses like France and Switzerland.

        <br>Another significant moment came in 2023. Strong performances and positive results have brought the national team very close to qualifying for Euro 2024.
        
        Albanian clubs have also achieved high results in European competitions. Teams like Tirana, Vllaznia, and Flamurtari have shown excellent results over the years. The pinnacle of these clubs is Skenderbeu FC, a team that has participated several times in the Europa League.</p>

            <h4><em><strong>Identity</strong></em></h4>
            <p><strong>Nicknames</strong></p>
            <p>Albania has had several nicknames throughout history, the most notable of which are "Red and Black" and "Eagles". The national team is also known by the nickname "Kosova B" by the fans. In 2016, Kosovo and Albania began exchanging players after Kosovo received permission to compete in official competitions, leading fans to refer to the two teams as each other's backup teams.</p>
            <p><strong>Uniforms</strong></p>
            <p>The traditional uniform of Albania is a red jersey with black shorts and red socks. The second uniform is usually white with red or black trim. In the 2000s, Albania signed with the German sportswear company Puma, which became Albania's first uniform manufacturer in the 21st century. On January 29, 2016, the national team signed an agreement with the Italian company Macron, which currently continues to produce the team's uniforms.</p>
